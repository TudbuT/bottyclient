# snekfetch <sup>[![Version Badge][version-badge]][npm]</sup>

Snekfetch is a fast, efficient, and user-friendly library for making HTTP requests.

The API was inspired by superagent, however it is much smaller and faster.
In fact, in browser, it is a mere 4.4kb.

Documentation is available at https://snekfetch.js.org/

## Some examples

```javascript
const request = require('snekfetch');

request.post('https://httpbin.org/post')
  .send({ usingGoodRequestLibrary: true })
  .then(r => console.log(r.body)); // r.body is object from json response

request.get('https://s.gc.gy/o-SNAKES.jpg')
  .then(r => fs.writeFile('download.jpg', r.body)); // r.body is buffer

request.get('https://s.gc.gy/o-SNAKES.jpg')
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('download.jpg')); // pipes
```

Available for browser as UMD from [unpkg][unpkg-link]
